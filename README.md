# Homework

> Welcome to my homework project!

I've used Vue/Nuxt.js version 2 with Vuetify UI library for some parts,
on the product list I've intentionally tried to skip it just so to use
plain CSS and HTML.

Since i didn't have the opportunity to work with application unit testing,
this is but an attempt at it, i've never actually done it in an 
application. So sorry if its a bit basic, it was a lot of time setting it up
so it works.

## Build Setup
The version of Node.js i've used for the project is 16.13.1.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
