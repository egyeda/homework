# Homework

> Welcome to my homework project!

I've used Vue/Nuxt.js version 2 with Vuetify UI library for some parts,
on the product list i've intentionally tried to skip it just so to use
plain CSS and HTML.

## Build Setup
The version of Node.js i've used for the project is 16.13.1.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
