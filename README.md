# Homework

> Welcome to my homework project!

I've used Vue/Nuxt.js version 2 with Vuetify UI library for some parts,
on the product list and product card I've intentionally tried to skip it just so to use
plain CSS and HTML.

Since I didn't have the opportunity to work with application unit testing,
this is but an attempt at it (i have no clue what i'm doing), I've never actually done 
it in an application. So yeah its really basic, it was a lot of time setting it up
so it actually works. :D

Also any kind of feedback is welcome if you have any, thanks!

## Build Setup
The version of Node.js I've used to run the project is 16.13.1. I've tried to run it
with newer versions, but it didnt really work for me.

For Node.js version switching I use NVM https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
